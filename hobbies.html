      <div class="hobby-item">
        <h3>1. Coding and Game Development</h3>
        <p>
          One of my biggest passions is coding, especially when it comes to creating interactive games. I love to dive deep into Python and other languages, crafting fun experiences like the **Runner-Snail-Jump** game. Building games has helped me hone my problem-solving skills and creativity, allowing me to bring my ideas to life through technology.

        <h3>2. Reading </h3>
        <p>
          I'm an avid reader, especially of realisitic fiction and speculative fiction. I enjoy exploring futuristic worlds, imagining what technology and society might look like in the years to come. This genre has always been a source of inspiration for my personal projects and keeps my curiosity alive.

        <h3>3. Playing and Learning New Musical Instruments</h3>
        <p>
          Music has always been a form of relaxation for me. I enjoy playing the piano and the guitar in my spare time, experimenting with different styles and melodies. Recently, I’ve been learning new instruments, which gives me a refreshing break from coding while fueling my creativity in other areas. I love playing music, listening to music, and song writing. I play the saxophone, bass guitar, keyboard, viola, acoustic guitar, and I used to play the clarinet. Music has always been an integral part of my life and will remain one.

        <h3>4. Skateboarding</h3>
        <p>
            Skateboarding is one of my favorite ways to stay active and have fun. I enjoy practicing new tricks and cruising around town, feeling the rush of excitement when I land something challenging. Skateboarding helps me stay physically fit while offering a break from my daily routine, giving me a perfect balance between work and play.

        <h3>5. Cooking</h3>
        <p>
            I love spending time in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and cooking techniques. Cooking allows me to combine creativity with practicality, and it’s always satisfying to share a good meal with friends or family. Whether I'm baking pastries or trying out international dishes, the kitchen is a place where I can unwind and express myself.
