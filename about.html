      <h2><b><i><u>About Me</u></i></b></h2>
      <p>My name is Goodnews Anjolaoluwa Babade, and I am a student at Wheeler High School. At 15 years old, I am actively involved in various academic and extracurricular programs. I participate in the Orchestra, Science Olympiad, USABO, and CircuitRunners, and I currently hold the position of Co-Director of Marketing for the USA Biology Olympiad team at my school. In addition to my school activities, I actively participate in my church and frequently perform gigs on my saxophone outside of school. I am passionate about music, art, skateboarding, reading, and continuous learning. I also have a strong love for volunteering, dedicating time to causes that matter to me.</p>
